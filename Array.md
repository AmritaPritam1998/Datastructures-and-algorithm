what are data structures?
data structures are collection of data values,the relationship among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

--array is a pre-built datastructures.

why do u need to learn them to ace coding interviews?
input---algorithms---output
---some datastructres are more efficient than others to do some tasks.

complexity analysis ,BIG O
1.what is the need for complexity analysis?
****faster ---time complexity.
and less memory.--space complexity.
counting number of simple operations computer has to do ---time complexity.
how runtime grows as the input size grows--time complexity

Asyomptotic analysis-checking when n tends to very large
as n or input grows in what proprotion does number of operation grows.
Expressed using Big O notation.

Big O Notation----how runtime of an algorithm grows as input grows.
ia a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
the letter o is used  because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function.

0(n)--- as input size increases the time taken is increases linearly. 

common complexity
0(n)--operations is bounded by a multiple of n.as input size increases time taken increases linearly.traverse elements  of array and add them.
0(1)------constant---the no of input sizes doesnot increases as size of input size increases
0(logn)---increases slowly--binary search algorithm
0(nlogn)--merge sort 
0(n^2)----
0(2^n)---fibonacci series
0(n!)---steep increases
